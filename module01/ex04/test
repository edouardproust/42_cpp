I woke up feeling sad, the rain tapping against the window like it understood my mood.
It was a sad day, not just because of the weather, but because everything felt wrong.
The empty streets looked sad, the gray sky hung low, and even the birds seemed too sad to sing.
As I sat alone in the caf√©, sipping cold coffee, I couldn't help but think how sad it is to be
circled by people and still feel so alone.
